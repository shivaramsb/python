Boolean – which holds either true or falls value in it , it mainly used in conditional statements.

Dictionary – this type is used in in holding key-pair kind of values can be used to store id password kind of thing.


4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Statement means which express data but didn’t process to give new value.

Expression has two sides which bound to process given data and produce new results.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?

- 23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

Variable names must begin with a letter from A-Z or the underscore _ character. Either lowercase or uppercase letters are acceptable


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

The str() , int() , and float() functions will evaluate to the string, integer, or floating-point number form of the value they are passed.


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'


-	Because int values cannot be concatenated.
-	'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'
